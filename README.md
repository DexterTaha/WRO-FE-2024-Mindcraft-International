The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a prestigious international robotics competition that ignites the imaginations of students worldwide. It challenges participants to showcase their creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical prowess in designing and programming robots for a variety of tasks and challenges.

One of the most dynamic categories within WRO is the Future Engineers category. Here, participants are tasked with developing innovative solutions to real-world problems using robotics and automation. This category serves as a breeding ground for future innovators, encouraging students to think critically and creatively, laying the groundwork for a new generation of engineers and technologists.

This year, the Future Engineers category presents an exciting challenge: creating a self-driving car. This challenge pushes participants to explore the cutting edge of robotics, adding layers of complexity and innovation to an already thrilling competition.

# WRO Future Engineers Competition

| **1.Mobility Management**             |
|:---------------------------------------|
| Mobility management discussion should cover how the vehicle movements are managed. What motors are selected, how they are selected and implemented. A brief discussion regarding the vehicle chassis design /selection can be provided as well as the mounting of all components to the vehicle chassis/structure. The discussion may include engineering principles such as speed, torque, power etc. usage. Building or assembly instructions can be provided together with 3D CAD files to 3D print parts.|
