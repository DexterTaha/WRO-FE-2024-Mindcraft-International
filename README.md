The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a prestigious international robotics competition that ignites the imaginations of students worldwide. It challenges participants to showcase their creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical prowess in designing and programming robots for a variety of tasks and challenges.

One of the most dynamic categories within WRO is the Future Engineers category. Here, participants are tasked with developing innovative solutions to real-world problems using robotics and automation. This category serves as a breeding ground for future innovators, encouraging students to think critically and creatively, laying the groundwork for a new generation of engineers and technologists.

This year, the Future Engineers category presents an exciting challenge: creating a self-driving car. This challenge pushes participants to explore the cutting edge of robotics, adding layers of complexity and innovation to an already thrilling competition.
