The steering system is powered by a 25T steering arm connected to the front axle, which acts as a joint rotating around a horizontal axis. This arm converts the rotational motion from the motor into angular motion for steering. It functions like a lever, translating torque into angular movement according to the equation \( \theta = \frac{T}{r} \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of rotation, \( T \) is the torque applied, and \( r \) is the length of the arm.

The front wheels rotate around a horizontal axis based on the angle of the 25T arm, enabling the robot to turn. The wheel's angle is determined by the axial rotation of the arm, as described by the equation \( \theta_{\text{wheel}} = \frac{L}{r} \cdot \theta_{\text{25T}} \), where \( L \) is the length of the steering linkage. Dynamic simulation ensures accurate translation of motion, optimizing the robot's steering performance.
