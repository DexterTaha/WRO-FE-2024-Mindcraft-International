### Rear Drive System Overview

The rear-drive system of the robot relies on a horizontally mounted electric motor connected to gear mechanisms. This system converts the motor’s rotational motion into the rotational movement of the rear wheels. The motor is linked to gears that reduce the rotational speed while increasing the torque applied to the wheels, enhancing the robot's ability to move steadily and efficiently.

The fundamental equation governing motion transfer is:

    θ_wheel = T / r

Where:
- θ_wheel represents the angular rotation of the rear wheels.
- T is the torque produced by the motor.
- r is the radius of the gear connected to the wheel.

This system allows the rear wheels to rotate around a horizontal axis, providing smooth movement and sufficient traction to propel the robot forward. The overall movement of the robot is controlled through the mechanical relationship between the motor, gears, and wheels, governed by the equation that relates torque to angular displacement.

This system relies on precise dynamic simulation to ensure optimal motion control, ensuring performance efficiency and fast response under various operating conditions.
