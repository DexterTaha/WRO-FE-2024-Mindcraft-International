# Mechanical Systems

## Rear-Drive System

The robot's rear-drive system uses a horizontally mounted electric motor connected to a gear mechanism. This system converts the motor’s rotational motion into the movement of the rear wheels. The motor is coupled with gears that reduce the speed but increase torque, providing stability and strength during movement. The higher torque helps in overcoming friction and other resistance while maintaining controlled speed.

- **Motor:** A high-torque electric motor designed to provide enough power for smooth forward and backward motion.
- **Gearing Mechanism:** The motor is connected to a set of gears that lower the rotational speed but increase the force applied to the wheels. This balance of torque and speed is crucial for maintaining the robot’s stability and allowing it to move efficiently across different terrains.

**Key Equation:**
\[
\theta_{\text{wheel}} = \frac{T}{r}
\]
Where:
- \(\theta_{\text{wheel}}\) = Angular displacement of the rear wheels
- \(T\) = Torque produced by the motor
- \(r\) = Radius of the gear connected to the wheels

The system allows the rear wheels to rotate smoothly, ensuring controlled movement and sufficient traction to propel the robot forward.

## Differential System

The robot features a differential system to manage the distribution of torque to the wheels, especially during turns. This system ensures that the wheels on either side of the robot can rotate at different speeds, which is essential for smooth turning and maneuverability.

- **Independent Wheel Rotation:** The differential ensures that during turns, the outer wheel rotates faster than the inner wheel. This prevents skidding and maintains smooth, controlled motion.
- **Torque Distribution:** By allowing dynamic torque distribution, the differential system enhances traction on varying surfaces.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Improved Handling:** Allows the robot to make sharper turns without losing traction.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Reduces strain on the motors and wheels, preventing wear and prolonging the robot’s lifespan.

## Steering System

The robot's steering mechanism is powered by a 25T steering arm connected to the front axle, allowing the front wheels to rotate for directional changes. The arm converts the rotational motion from the motor into angular displacement, effectively steering the robot.

- **Steering Arm:** Acts as a lever that converts the motor’s torque into angular motion for turning the wheels.
- **Steering Linkage:** A linkage system connects the steering arm to the wheels, allowing for precise control over the turning angle.

**Key Equation:**
\[
\theta_{\text{wheel}} = \frac{L}{r} \times \theta_{\text{25T}}
\]
Where:
- \(\theta_{\text{wheel}}\) = Angular displacement of the front wheels
- \(L\) = Length of the steering linkage
- \(r\) = Length of the 25T arm

This system allows the robot to make accurate and smooth turns, with precise control over the steering angle.

# Sensors and Autonomous Navigation

## Laser-Based Distance Sensors

The robot is equipped with four laser-based distance sensors placed at the front, rear, and both sides. These sensors measure the distance to nearby obstacles using laser beams that reflect off objects. By calculating the time it takes for the beam to return, the robot can estimate distances and avoid collisions.

- **Front and Rear Sensors:** Used to detect obstacles in the robot’s path, enabling it to avoid collisions while moving forward or backward.
- **Side Sensors:** Allow the robot to detect objects during turns, ensuring smooth maneuvers even in tight spaces.

These sensors provide the robot with 360-degree environmental awareness, enabling it to navigate autonomously by detecting obstacles from all directions.

## Sensor Data Integration

All sensor data is integrated into a real-time map of the robot’s surroundings, allowing the robot to make autonomous decisions. The system analyzes input from each sensor, processes it, and adjusts the robot’s path or speed accordingly. This enables obstacle avoidance and ensures the robot selects optimal routes.

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot can stop, turn, or slow down based on real-time input from the sensors, ensuring smooth navigation around obstacles.
- **Path Optimization:** The sensors help the robot determine the best path to follow, minimizing the risk of collisions.

## Autonomous Navigation Algorithms

The robot employs several advanced algorithms to handle obstacle avoidance and path planning. By combining the data from the distance sensors with these algorithms, the robot can make dynamic decisions while navigating complex environments.

- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** This algorithm helps the robot map its environment in real time and navigate without pre-programmed routes.
- **Vector Field Histogram (VFH):** A dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm that helps the robot navigate tight spaces by choosing optimal paths based on detected obstacles.

# Motors and Electronics

## Motor Control

The robot’s motors are controlled by a microcontroller that adjusts speed and torque based on the input from the sensors and steering system. The control system ensures smooth transitions between different speeds and directional changes.

- **Motor Drivers:** Provide power to the motors, ensuring consistent torque and speed, especially during complex maneuvers.
- **PWM Control:** Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to adjust the power sent to the motors, allowing for fine control over the robot’s speed.

## Microcontroller and Processing Unit

A powerful microcontroller (such as a Raspberry Pi or Arduino) manages the robot’s operations. It processes sensor data, controls the motors, and runs the navigation algorithms.

- **Data Processing:** The microcontroller collects data from all the sensors and makes real-time decisions about movement and obstacle avoidance.
- **Control Signals:** It sends signals to the motors and steering system to adjust speed and direction based on environmental feedback.

## Power Supply

The robot is powered by a high-capacity battery, providing enough energy to run the motors, sensors, and processing unit for extended periods.

- **Voltage Regulation:** A voltage regulator ensures stable power delivery to all components, preventing fluctuations that could affect performance.

# 3D Printing and Custom Parts

## 3D Printed Components

Many parts of the robot, including the chassis and some gear components, are 3D printed. This allows for lightweight yet sturdy construction and enables easy customization for specific tasks.

- **Material:** PLA or ABS is commonly used for printing parts, as these materials offer a good balance of strength and flexibility.
- **Customization:** The use of 3D printing allows the design of custom parts tailored to the robot’s specific needs, such as unique mounts for sensors or gear housings for the differential system.
