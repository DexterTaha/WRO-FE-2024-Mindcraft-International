# Future Engineers Map Randomizer and Score Calculator:

This project provides an interactive web-based tool for the WRO Future Engineers competition, offering a randomizer and score calculator for map setups. Itâ€™s designed to help participants practice in varied, randomized environments and quickly calculate scores based on performance.

## Features:
- Map Randomizer: Automatically generates randomized layouts for obstacles and scoring zones, preparing teams for a range of possible scenarios.
- Score Calculator: Allows for quick, manual input of robot actions to calculate scores based on the competition's rules.
- Responsive Design: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth and accessible experience across devices.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design that makes setup and scoring easy to navigate.

## Usage:
1) Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html file in any modern browser.
2) Generate a Map Layout: Use the randomizer feature to produce a randomized map setup.
3) Score Calculation: Input robot interactions with the map elements, and the tool will automatically calculate the score.

## Files:
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure and randomizer display.
- `styl.css` - Styling for layout and interactive elements.
