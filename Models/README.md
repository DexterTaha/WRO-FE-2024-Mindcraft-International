## 1. WRO Future Engineers Robot - Models (Design & Manufacturing Process + 3D Files)

This section covers the **CAD modeling and manufacturing process** behind the development of our robot for the **WRO Future Engineers competition**, explaining our design tools, choices, and manufacturing techniques. The following highlights the key decisions in our process and why they benefit the project.

### 1.1. 3D CAD Modeling - Onshape

To design and develop the robot, we used **Onshape**, a cloud-based CAD tool that allows for efficient collaboration and design flexibility. We had various options for CAD software, such as **Fusion 360** and **CATIA**, but we ultimately chose Onshape for several reasons:

#### 1.1.1. Why We Chose Onshape
- **Cloud-Based**: Operates entirely in the cloud for collaborative design.
- **Collaborative Design**: Multiple team members can work simultaneously.
- **Free for Educational Use**: Accessible for students without extra costs.
- **No Hardware Constraints**: Browser-based, requires no high-end hardware.

#### 1.1.2. Other CAD Options Considered
- **Fusion 360**: Hybrid cloud solution, limited collaboration, and costs.
- **CATIA**: Too complex and expensive for our needs.

#### 1.1.3. Onshape Advantages
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Accelerates the design process.
- **Accessible Anywhere**: Work from any device with internet.
- **Powerful CAD Tools**: Advanced features for complex designs.
- **Version Control**: Track changes and revert to previous versions.

### 1.2. 3D Printing

Once our designs were finalized, we needed to choose a manufacturing method. We considered several techniques like **laser cutting**, **CNC engraving**, and **3D printing**, ultimately deciding on **3D printing** for its flexibility.

#### 1.2.1. Why We Chose 3D Printing
- **Complex Geometries**: Enables custom shapes that are hard to achieve otherwise.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Allows quick printing and testing of parts.
- **Cost-Effective**: More affordable for prototypes.
- **Less Material Waste**: Only uses necessary material.

#### 1.2.2. Printer of Choice: Creality K1 Max
- **Large Build Volume**: Prints large components in one go.
- **High Speed**: Fast print speeds maintain project pace.
- **Precision**: Ensures mechanical parts fit perfectly.
- **Ease of Use**: Ideal for students and quick prototyping.

#### 1.2.3. Why We Didn't Choose Laser Cutting or CNC Engraving
- **Laser Cutting**: Limited to flat parts, not suitable for 3D shapes.
- **CNC Engraving**: Higher setup time and costs, more waste.

#### 1.2.4. Advantages of 3D Printing
- **Customization**: Easy to modify designs and print new parts quickly.
- **Quick Turnaround**: Enables rapid prototyping and testing.
- **Sustainable**: Less material waste aligns with our sustainability goals.
