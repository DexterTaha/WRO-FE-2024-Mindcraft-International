# 1. WRO Future Engineers Robot - Models (Design & Manufacturing Process + 3D files)

This section covers the **CAD modeling and manufacturing process** behind the development of our robot for the **WRO Future Engineers competition**, explaining our design tools, choices, and manufacturing techniques. The following highlights the key decisions in our process and why they benefit the project.

## 1.1. 3D CAD Modeling - Onshape

To design and develop the robot, we used **Onshape**, a cloud-based CAD tool that allows for efficient collaboration and design flexibility. We had various options for CAD software, such as **Fusion 360** and **CATIA**, but we ultimately chose Onshape for several reasons:

### 1.1.1. Why We Chose Onshape

- **Cloud-Based**: Onshape operates entirely in the cloud, allowing our team to collaborate from any location. This was essential since team members were working from different places.
- **Collaborative Design**: Multiple team members can work on the same design simultaneously, ensuring faster iterations and feedback loops.
- **Free for Educational Use**: Being students representing Morocco, Onshape’s free educational plan provided us with full access to powerful design tools without extra costs.
- **No Hardware Constraints**: Onshape runs in a web browser, meaning we didn’t need high-end computers or complex software installations. This allowed everyone on the team to contribute regardless of their hardware limitations.

You can learn more about Onshape here: [Onshape Website](https://www.onshape.com/)

Here are some screenshots of our robot's 3D model in Onshape:

### 1.1.2. Other CAD Options Considered:
- **Fusion 360**: A hybrid cloud CAD/CAM solution, but not fully cloud-based, limiting real-time collaboration. It also has paid plans that weren't ideal for our educational project.
- **CATIA**: An industrial-grade CAD tool, but too complex and expensive for our needs, especially since our project required fast prototyping and team collaboration.

### 1.1.3. Onshape Advantages
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the design at the same time, accelerating the design process.
- **Accessible Anywhere**: Since it’s cloud-based, we could work on designs from any device with an internet connection.
- **Powerful CAD Tools**: Despite being browser-based, Onshape provides all the advanced CAD features we needed to design complex mechanical components for our robot.
- **Version Control**: We could easily track changes, revert to previous versions, and work on multiple iterations without losing progress.

## 1.2. 3D Printing

Once our designs were finalized in Onshape, we needed to choose a manufacturing method. We considered several techniques like **laser cutting**, **CNC engraving**, and **3D printing**, but we ultimately decided to use **3D printing** due to its flexibility and ability to produce complex parts for our robot.

### 1.2.1. Why We Chose 3D Printing
- **Complex Geometries**: 3D printing allowed us to create complex and custom geometries that are difficult to achieve with laser cutting or CNC engraving.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: We could quickly print and test various parts, allowing us to make fast iterations on our robot design.
- **Cost-Effective**: 3D printing is often more affordable for one-off parts or prototypes compared to CNC engraving or laser cutting, which require more setup and material waste.
- **Less Material Waste**: 3D printing only uses the material needed for the part, reducing waste and lowering costs.

### 1.2.2. Printer of Choice: Creality K1 Max

We selected the **Creality K1 Max** 3D printer for manufacturing our robot parts. This printer has several key advantages:

- **Large Build Volume**: The K1 Max provides a large build area, allowing us to print large components of the robot in a single go without having to divide them into smaller parts.
- **High Speed**: With fast print speeds, we were able to print our parts in a short amount of time, keeping up with the rapid pace of our project.
- **Precision**: The Creality K1 Max delivers high accuracy and detail in its prints, ensuring that our robot's mechanical parts fit together perfectly.
- **Ease of Use**: The printer is easy to set up and use, even for students, making it an ideal choice for quick prototyping.

### 1.2.3. Why We Didn't Choose Laser Cutting or CNC Engraving

- **Laser Cutting**: While laser cutting is great for creating flat, 2D parts, it is limited in producing complex 3D shapes and detailed mechanical components.
- **CNC Engraving**: CNC is excellent for metal and wood parts but involves more setup time and higher costs, especially for custom parts. It also generates more material waste, making it less ideal for our project, which requires many iterations.

### 1.2.4. Advantages of 3D Printing
- **Customization**: We can easily make modifications to the design and print new parts within hours.
- **Quick Turnaround**: 3D printing enabled us to quickly prototype, test, and refine parts, significantly reducing development time.
- **Sustainable**: With 3D printing, there’s less waste of materials, aligning with our goal of sustainability for this project.

## 1.5. Conclusion

For our **WRO Future Engineers robot project**, using **Onshape for CAD modeling** and the **Creality K1 Max for 3D printing** has been a critical part of our design and manufacturing process. These tools allowed us to work collaboratively, iterate quickly, and produce complex parts efficiently, all while staying within the constraints of an educational project.

Thank you for following our journey as we design a cutting-edge robot to represent **Morocco** on the global stage at the **World Robot Olympiad**!
